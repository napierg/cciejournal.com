This is my first post on my new CCIE Journey. 

This site will be the way i document my knowledge, get lab fit and create the circumstances to get my number and beyond.

It's also they way i keep myself honest, as its a long journey and its easy to pause, to ease up and to really push that date out...

But a weekly update, a schedule to keep and eyes on my progress will keep me pushing on.

So, please do keep stopping by, learn something and keep my ambition going strong.

Thanks
Gary
